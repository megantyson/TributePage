<p id="tribute-info">Birmingham is a major city in the UKâ€™s West Midlands region, with multiple Industrial Revolution-era landmarks that speak to its 18th-century history as a manufacturing powerhouse. By the Victorian era, the city was known as the 'Workshop of the World'. Birmingham is also home to a network of canals, many of which are now lined with trendy cafes and bars. In fact, there are more miles of canals in Birmingham than in Venice!</p>
